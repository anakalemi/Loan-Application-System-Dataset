# Loan-Application-System-Dataset
This repository contains the dataset used in the research paper titled "Process Optimization using Process Mining: A study case for Albania." The paper focuses on the implementation of process mining as a powerful data analysis technique for visualizing, analyzing, and improving business processes in Albania.

## Abstract
Process mining is a powerful data analysis technique that uses event logs to visualize, analyze, and improve business processes. The primary objective of this research is to emphasize the significance of implementing this approach to optimize business processes in Albania. The advantages were observed throughout the analysis of the illustrative study case with the event log synthesized from a loan application system of a financial institution. The event log is the foundation of process mining as it contains the necessary data from where inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and deviations can be identified. Moreover, the observations can lead to recommendations and enhancements that can improve the overall process performance. The results contribute to the growing body of literature on process mining and offer practical implications for organizations seeking to adopt process mining in their operations.
## Dataset
The dataset provided in this repository consists of the event log synthesized from a loan application system of a financial institution in Albania. This event log serves as the foundation for the process mining analysis conducted in the research paper. It contains the necessary data to identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and deviations within the loan application process.
